Two or more races employees report the lowest performance, engagement, and slightly above average satisfaction, which suggests they may need additional attention or support. Gender-based findings: No major differences between male and female employees in terms of performance or engagement. However, females report slightly higher job satisfaction. Ethnicity-based findings: Hispanic employees have higher engagement and slightly lower satisfaction than their non-Hispanic counterparts.

As well as the emergence of feelings of not having enough challenges or progress (bored). Therefore, Low satisfaction is clearly a high risk for resigning.'
